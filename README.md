# üí´ About Me:
Hello! I am a passionate software developer with one year of experience in Python. I have worked on a variety of projects across different domains in IT and technology, ranging from web development to cloud computing.<br><br>In particular, my recent projects have been focused on using AWS and Django to build scalable and efficient web applications. I also have some experience with JavaScript and Java. While Python is my primary language, I am always eager to learn new technologies and programming languages.<br><br>Currently, I am learning more about cloud technologies and AI, as I believe these fields have a lot of potential for driving innovation and solving complex problems. I am also interested in data science and machine learning, and I enjoy exploring how these technologies can be applied in various domains.<br><br>If you have any questions about my experience or expertise, feel free to ask me about Python programming, web development, cloud computing, or anything related to software development. I'm always happy to share my knowledge and insights with others.<br><br>Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games and reading science fiction novels. I find that both of these hobbies help me stay creative and inspired, and they give me a break from staring at a computer screen all day!<br><br>If you're interested in working together or learning more about my skills and experience, feel free to contact me or check out my GitHub profile for more information. Thank you for stopping by!
